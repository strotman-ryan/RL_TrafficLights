What things make up an intersection
     - automobiles

     - the center section
     - arrows/signals (like on the ground or on a sign)
     - Pedestrians
     - walkways
     - sensors (cameras) (inducion loops)
     

Cars:

	  - its licence plate
	  - how big it is
	  - where it is coming from
	  - where it is going
	- can see the lights
	- knows what lane it is in

	  - what state it is in (green yellow red)
	  - knows how to change colors and how long yellow needs to be


Lanes:
	- What does a lane know?
